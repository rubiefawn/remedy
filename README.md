Remedy is a tabletop role-playing game whose mechanics actively facilitate storytelling, rather than describing it with stats and numbers.

- Descriptive traits instead of ability scores. Use traits to help overcome challenges, or use them to make challenges harder for extra experience.
- Skills with levels and experience instead of character levels and experience. Learn from failure.
- Structured time encourages taking notes and sharing the spotlight.
