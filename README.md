Remedy is a tabletop role-playing game whose mechanics actively facilitate storytelling, rather than describing it with stats and numbers.

- Descriptive traits instead of ability scores. While they can be used to help yourself, using them to hinder yourself is narratively interesting and mechanically rewarding.
- Skills with levels and experience instead of character levels and experience. Learn from failure.
- Relationships-as-skills incentivizes building connections and interacting with the setting.
- Structured time encourages taking notes and sharing the spotlight.
