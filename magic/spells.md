## Attract/Repel

_γ class Auramancy \(Level 8\)_   
**Components** V, S, M \(a spoonful of honey, a piece of wool soaked in vinegar\)   
**Casting Time** 1 hour  
**Range** 60 feet  
**Duration** 10 days

This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either an object, creature, or area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of creature. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose whether the aura attracts or repels the specified creatures when you cast this spell.

When a creature of the kind you specified enters an area within 60 feet of the target or can see it, the creature feels an intense urge to either approach the target or flee from it, depending on which effect you chose. It must succeed a Resist Enchantment check or be affected by the aura.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Attraction" %}
An affected creature cannot willingly move further away from the target, and must use movement on each of its turns to move closer to the target.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Repulsion" %}
An affected creature cannot willingly move closer to the target, and must use movement on each of its turns to move away from the target.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, or the creature takes damage from or is otherwise harmed by the target, the creature can make another Resist Enchantment check. On a success, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the effect as magical. In addition, each effected creature may make another Resist Enchantment check every 24 hours.

A creature that succeeds a Resist Enchantment check against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.
