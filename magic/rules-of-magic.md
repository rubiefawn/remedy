# Rules of Magic

## Spell Class

Spells are divided into four classes, each denoting the complexity of the magic involved in casting each spell. While anything is possible with magic, effects based on science are much easier to produce than those manifested by pure willpower. The spell classes are as listed:

* **δ class magic** is the simplest form of magic. δ class spells either amplify existing and natural effects, such as turning a rainstorm into a thunderstorm, or produce naturally-occurring phenomena such as cooling water, turning it to ice. δ class spells are not permanent.
* **γ class magic** produces unnatural and otherwise impossible effects temporarily, such as creating gold out of thin air or making someone fall in love with you... for a time. γ class magic is inherently temporary, and the natural order of things will reassert themselves once the magic is spent.
* **β class magic** bends existing natural forces and phenomena permanently. For example, like δ class magic, β class magic can freeze water into ice, but the ice will never thaw without magical help. β class magic includes many of the most powerful spells, but is limited by the laws and logic of reality.
* **α class magic** is the most powerful form of magic, and is totally unrestricted. α class magic can create any effect, natural or unnatural, permanently. The effects of α class magic can only be undone by other magic, showing that it itself is a natural force governing reality. Whatever is done by α class magic simply is.

## Spell Tolerance

Magic can be difficult to learn, understand, or reverse. Spell Tolerance describes a special kind of Erudition-based check used in these kinds of situations.

Spell Tolerance is not listed as a skill, because aptitude and mastery for it comes from the spell asking for such a check. If you cast a spell that asks for a Spell Tolerance check, your aptitude level for the check is the same as the spell being cast.

The DC of a Spell Tolerance check is equal to twice the level of the spell \(or whatever level that spell was cast at\), plus an extra amount depending on the class of the magical effect: +0 for δ class, +2 for γ class, +4 for β class, and +8 for α class.

## Spell Improvisation

Sometimes, one desires to cast a spell they do not know or has not yet been invented. Such a task can require hours to years of study and research, but one with a clear idea of the effect they want to create can attempt to improvise the spell, with varying degrees of success.

To cast a spell you do not know, you first expend mana of the correct level for the desired spell, then make a [Spell Tolerance](rules-of-magic.md#spell-tolerance) check. On a success, you cast the spell normally \(without [aptitude](../skills.md#aptitude)\). On a failure, the spell does not take effect, and your mana is wasted, along with any material components that would be consumed by the spell.
