# Conditions

A condition lasts either until it is removed, or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. Conditions may specify their own rules on how they can be removed.

Some conditions can be gained multiple times, while others cannot. If a condition does not specify otherwise and it is gained more than once, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the effect is only applied once.

## Angry

The Angry condition represents extreme frustration or hatred that clouds one’s thinking.

* An Angry creature suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom-based checks.

A creature can become Angry more than once, but only once from each source.

## Blinded

The Blinded condition represents temporary or permanent impairment to a sense. When a creature becomes Blinded, the imposing effect may specify which sense it blinds \(tremorsense, sphynxvision, truevision\), but if it does not, it is referring to vision & darkvision.

* A Blinded creature automatically fails all checks that require the affected sense.

A creature can become Blinded more than once, as long as a different sense is affected each time.

## Charmed

The Charmed condition represents strong but unsafe positive emotions, such as infatuation or idolization, either natural or artificially induced by magical means.

When three successes occur, the Dying creature falls Unconscious and stops Dying. When three failures occur, the creature dies.
