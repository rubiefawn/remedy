# Damage & Healing

## Damage Resistance & Vulnerability

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

### Damage Immunity

If a creature or object has immunity to a damage type, damage of that type is ignored against it.

## Healing Types

Healing types can optionally be referred to by their symbols.

| Healing Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `💖 healing` | Regular healing restores lost hit points. A creature cannot exceed its hit point maximum from this kind of healing. |
| `💛 temporary` | Temporary hit points act as a buffer. There is no limit to how many temporary hit points a creature can have. Temporary hit points, however, do not stack; when a creature who already has temporary hit points receives more, the amounts do not stack, and the creature must choose which amount to keep. |
