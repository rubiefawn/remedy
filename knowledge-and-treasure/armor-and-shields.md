# Armor & Shields

## Armor

Not all attacks can be consistently evaded, and some sources of damage are impossible to dodge at all. Armor serves as a protection against different kinds of damage by providing Defense and Soak.

| Armor | Vitality Minimum | Defense | Soak |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| Light Armor | ±0 | 2 vs. 💢🧊🩸 | 1 vs. 💢🩸 |
| Medium Armor | +1 | 3 vs. 💢🧊🔥🩸 | 2 vs. 💢🩸 |
| Heavy Armor | +2 | 4 vs. 💢🧪🧊🔥🩸 | 3 vs. 💢🩸 |

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Incompetence <a id="incompetence"></a>

When wearing any armor with which you are incompetent, you suffer threat on all Agility-based checks.

#### Mastery

You may ignore the minimum vitality requirement for any armor you have mastery with.
{% endhint %}

## Shields

Shields can also provide Soak, but unlike armor, they must be actively used in order to be effective. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to apply the shield's Soak against that attack.

| Shield | Vitality Minimum | Soak |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Wicker Shield | -1 | 1 vs. 💢🩸 |
| Wooden Shield | ±0 | 1 vs. 💢🧪⚡🩸 |
| Metal Shield | +1 | 2 vs. 💢🧪🔥🩸 |
| Tower Shield | +2 | 3 vs. 💢🧪🔥🌟🩸 |

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Incompetence <a id="incompetence"></a>

When using shields when you are incompetent with them, you must first succeed a difficulty 10 Reflex check in order to apply the shield's Soak.

#### Mastery

You may ignore the minimum vitality requirement for shields if you have mastery with them.
