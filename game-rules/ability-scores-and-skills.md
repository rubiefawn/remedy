# Ability Scores & Skills

## Ability Scores

Ability scores are four numerical values that quantify the inborn ability and talent of a character or creature. Ability scores range from -5 to +5, with the average being 0. Each ability score has a symbol, by which it can be referred to for short. 

| Ability Score | Symbol | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Vitality | 💪 | Physical toughness, endurance, strength |
| Agility | 🎯 | Physical dexterity, finesse, nimbleness |
| Identity | 👤 | Mental toughness, personality, spirit |
| Wisdom | 🎓 | Mental dexterity, intelligence, intuition, perception |

## Skills & Tools

While ability scores represent the raw ability of a character or creature, skills represent specialization, focus, and experience a creature may or may not have in any certain area. All skills fall under one of the four ability scores, representing a specialization under that general ability.

Sometimes, proper tools are required in order to even attempt a certain task. Tools have their own proficiency associated with them, just like skills. However, unlike skills, checks with tools are not bound to a single ability score by default. When you make a check with tools, the storyteller determines the appropriate ability score based on the task you are attempting with those tools \(picking a lock with thieves' tools might be Agility, but building a trap with thieves' tools might be Wisdom\).

### Proficiency

Proficiency is a measurement of a character's experience with a certain skill or item, and changes how checks with that item or skill are made. Three levels of proficiency exist: incompetence, aptitude, and mastery; incompetence being the default. When a character gains proficiency with a skill or item, their proficiency increases from incompetence to aptitude, or aptitude to mastery.

| Proficiency | Checks |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incompetence | 2d20, keep lowest result |
| Aptitude | 1d20 |
| Mastery | 2d20, keep highest result |

## Expertise

Sometimes, a character might have special knowledge that helps in a situation. This special knowledge is called Expertise. When making a check where an expertise could help, you may briefly debate with the storyteller how the expertise helps your character in that situation. If the storyteller agrees, you may make the check with dominance. The storyteller determines what kind of die to use for the dominance, if any.

Below is a non-comprehensive list of expertises. Depending on your character's background, you and the storyteller might work together to add an expertise not found on the list.
